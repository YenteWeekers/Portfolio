                <h3>Unity 2D Fighting Game: A Journey of Code Mastery and Animation Artistry<br>
                    From the beginning of the project's, my primary goal was clear: to push the boundaries of my coding while dunking myself in the world of animation creation. As a developer with a passion for challenges, I saw this adventure as the perfect opportunity to expand my skill set and dive into some unknown territories as I never animated before.
                    I am eager to experiment with the animator and explore the potential that animation brings as it give the game a more realistic look and a better game experience.
                    <br><br>
                    every project carries its own requirements of challenges and skills. you can see these in the picture on your right.</h3>

                <h3 class="first_textPlayer">making a unity 2d game is obviously a big challenge. At the outset, I faced the task of mastering the intricacies of animation creation. With none experience in this part, I approached it with a mix of curiosity and determination. First i did some research on how animating works and did some practice experimentation, The process was both rewarding and challenging. From making the animations in the animation toolkit till adding them in the players animator. I am really proud how it turned out and how well I picked it up.</h3>
                <h3 class="second_textPlayer">I looked for a way to create clearer code and avoid as mush copy paste as possible that would allow for easy extensibility and maintenance. After doing a lot of research i came by the power of inheritance. After some experimenting I was able to create common behaviors, ease the development process and improve code readability.â€¨than I came by the challenge of the combat interactions. To address this, I experimented with Unity's physics overlapCircleAll function, using it to detect if an enemy was within range of the player's attacks. By casting a circle collider around the player and checking for overlaps with enemy colliders, I was able to accurately determine enemy closeness, enabling flawless combat engagements and dynamic game play experiences. However, the journey was not without its setbacks. There were moments of frustration and doubt. Yet, with dedication and a willingness to seek help when needed, I overcame these obstacles and I am proud of how it came out.</h3>

                    <h3>The journey of developing enemies was a labyrinth of challenges and creative problem-solving. Among the most complicated obstacles was applying attack behavior based on the player's closeness a presentation that required fineness and ingenuity. first I needed for the enemies a customize distance for each attacks according to the player's distance. As I envisioned, when the player was at a steady distance, the enemy would unleash a barrage of fireballs. However, as the player closed in, the enemy's tactics needed to evolve, in a fly attack when the player came even closer that it almost touch the enemy it would start jumping and flying a little away to avoid that the enemy would continuously running into the player.</h3>
                    <h3>because of the complexity of the task, witnessing the enemy come to life was extremely disappointing. Seeing the defective transition between different attack patterns, adjusting to the player's movements with stiffness and glitching. I wanted to keep trying implementing these varied attack patterns created a tough challenge. I needed to coordinate the timing and execution of each attack, so it would give it a more smooth transitions between them, seamlessly adjusting the enemy's behavior in real-time based on the player's movements. after days of improving timing, adjusting animations and attacks the transitions became a little smoother and more pleasant to play.</h3>

                <h3>I always appreciate receiving constructive feedback as it enables improvement and growth. One notable observation was that the codes in my projects were really unclear, making it challenging to read it back what let to difficulties when seeking for specific information that I needed later on, as code clarity is crucial for collaboration and future development. in my codes it even let to that at one point all my code were just untraceable. Another thing was my spread of focus. As I was making the game I was so convinced that I could make an enemy whit a lot of different abilities but I added to mush what made him supper jumpy and just angry but stil wanting to make this work I put way to mush time and effort in this so mush that I forgot everything else and at the end came the conclusion that I didnâ€™t had enough time. what was really a shame of the rest what could be really great. Another point raised was that the project didn't evoke a strong sense of being a game. this was because of the really jumpy, angry enemy it jumps aginst and on you like crazy it would fly around what made the interactivity just kind of terrible and The user experience is one of the most important things when making a game.
                </h3><br>
                <h3>On a positive note, I got really complimented on my motivation as I was working on my game  and animation work. This positive feedback serves as affirmation of my commitment to projects and the effectiveness of my efforts in bringing dynamic elements to life.
                    In summary, I am grateful for the constructive critique, as it provides valuable insights into areas for improvement. I am determined to address the noted concerns, ensuring that future projects are characterized by clear, well-organized code, a balanced spread of focus, and a more pronounced gaming experience. The positive feedback on motivation and animation serves as motivation to continue delivering high-quality work in these areas.
